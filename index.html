        <p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/cervical/basic_info/index.htm" class="link" target="_blank">According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, cancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow out of control. 
            Cancer is always named for the part of the body where it starts, even if it spreads to other body parts later. 
            When cancer starts in the cervix, it is called cervical cancer. The cervix connects the vagina (birth canal) to the upper part of the uterus. 
            The uterus (or womb) is where a baby grows when during pregnancy. Anyone with a cervix is at risk for cervical cancer. 
            It occurs most often in people over age 30. Long-lasting infection with certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main cause of cervical cancer. 
            HPV is a common virus that is passed from one person to another during sex. Unfortunately, in 2020 alone, there were approximately 604,000 new cases and 342,000 deaths worldwide.</p>
