        <h1><i><font color="#47c0bb">Every year, more than </font>300,000 women die from cervical cancer</i></h1>
        <p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/cervical/basic_info/index.htm" class="link" target="_blank">According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, cancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow out of control. 
            Cancer is always named for the part of the body where it starts, even if it spreads to other body parts later. 
            When cancer starts in the cervix, it is called cervical cancer. The cervix connects the vagina (birth canal) to the upper part of the uterus. 
            The uterus (or womb) is where a baby grows when during pregnancy. Anyone with a cervix is at risk for cervical cancer. 
            It occurs most often in people over age 30. Long-lasting infection with certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main cause of cervical cancer. 
            HPV is a common virus that is passed from one person to another during sex. <b>Unfortunately, in 2020 alone, there were approximately 604,000 new cases and 342,000 deaths worldwide.</b></p>

        <p><a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cervical-cancer" class="link" target="_blank">The World Health Organization (WHO)</a> 
            recommends the <b>HPV vaccine</b> at age 9â€“14 years as a highly effective way to prevent HPV infection, cervical cancer and other HPV-related cancers
             and <b>screening</b> beginning from the age of 30 (25 years in women living with HIV) to detect cervical disease, but across countries, 
            <b>inequalities in access to vaccination, screening and treatment services</b>, risk factors including HIV prevalence, and social and economic determinants 
             such as sex, gender biases and poverty keeps cervical cancer as a significant global health issue.</p>
        <img src="coverage_by_income.png" alt="Image Description">
        <p>Data suggests that higher income countries, such as the United States and Sweden, have relatively high coverage at approximately 37%, 
            which is almost double the coverage of the following income group, the upper middle income, which includes countries such as Argentina and South Africa, 
            at a coverage of approximately 20%. Interestingly enough, the lower middle income group saw the worst coverage at approximately 8%, even compared to 
            low income countries, which saw a coverage of approximately 15%. Regardless, it is evidently clear that there is a discrepancy in coverage across income groups 
            <b>where the lower the income of a country, the lower the HPV vaccine coverage</b>.</p>

        </table>
        <p>Higher income countries that have relatively good HPV vaccine coverage compared to all other countries tend to have the slowest average possible case rate at 1.56 cases per year. 
            They are followed by the upper middle income countries at 2.25 cases per year, lower middle income countries at 110.52 cases per year, and the fastest group being the low income 
            countries at an alarming 222.18 cases per year. The same phenomenon we saw in the HPV vaccine coverage is observed here as the lower middle income countries have more possible 
            cases year-over-year than low income countries, which is opposite of what we expect. </p>

        </table>
        <p>A similar trend can be seen in the average death rate by income group as the high income countries that can afford widespread HPV vaccine coverage have the slowest average death rate 
            at 1.59 deaths per year, followed by the upper middle income countries at 2.38 deaths per year, then by the lower middle income countries at 86.02 deaths per year. Low income countries 
            have the fastest average death rate at 181.07 deaths per year. Thus, the HPV vaccine coverage differences between countries, that may be attributed to the wealth of a country, is widening 
            the gap that represents the severity of the cervix cancer health crisis over time. Low and lower middle income countries may need foreign aid to combat this health crisis.
